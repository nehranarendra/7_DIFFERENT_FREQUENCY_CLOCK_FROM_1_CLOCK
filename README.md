# 7_DIFFERENT_FREQUENCY_CLOCK_FROM_1_CLOCK

In this code, we instantiate an MMCM for each of the seven output clocks. You can configure the duty cycle, multiplication factor, and division factor for each output clock through the duty_cycle, multiply, and divide inputs.

Please note that this code is a simplified example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific FPGA and toolchain. Additionally, you should ensure that you have the necessary constraints for clock frequencies and input/output ports in your project's constraints file
